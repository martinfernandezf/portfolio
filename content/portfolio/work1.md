The website is generated from R Markdown documents (R is optional, i.e., you can use plain Markdown documents without R code chunks). This brings a huge amount of benefits, especially if your website is related to data analysis or (R) programming.

Being able to use Markdown implies simplicity and more importantly, portability (e.g., you are giving yourself the chance to convert your blog posts to PDF and publish to journals or even books in the future). R Markdown gives you the benefits of dynamic documents — all your results, such as tables, graphics, and inline values, can be computed and rendered dynamically from R code, hence the results you present on your website are more likely to be reproducible. An additional yet important benefit of using R Markdown is that you will be able to write technical documents easily, due to the fact that blogdown inherits the HTML output format from bookdown (Xie 2016). For example, it is possible to write LaTeX math equations, citations, and even theorems and proofs if you want.


>Please do not be misled by the word “blog” in the package name: blogdown is for general-purpose websites, and not only for blogs. For example, all authors of this book have their personal websites, where you can find information about their projects, blogs, package documentations, and so on.2 All their pages are built from blogdown and Hugo
